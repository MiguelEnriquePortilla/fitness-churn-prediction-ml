## üìê Business Rules & Data Quality

### **Data Validation Rules**
```sql
-- Age validation
Age BETWEEN 18 AND 100

-- Contract period validation  
Contract_period IN (1, 3, 6, 12)

-- Frequency logical validation
Avg_class_frequency_current_month >= 0 AND <= 7

-- Spending validation
Avg_additional_charges_total >= 0

-- Binary field validation
gender IN (0, 1)
Near_Location IN (0, 1)
Partner IN (0, 1)
Promo_friends IN (0, 1)
Phone IN (0, 1)
Group_visits IN (0, 1)
Churn IN (0, 1)

-- Tenure validation
Lifetime >= 0 AND Month_to_end_contract > 0
```

### **Business Logic Constraints**
- **Tenure Logic**: `Lifetime` cannot exceed 36 months (business operation period)
- **Contract Logic**: `Month_to_end_contract` cannot exceed `Contract_period`
- **Activity Logic**: `Avg_class_frequency_current_month` should be ‚â§ `Avg_class_frequency_total + 2` (reasonable variation)
- **Value Logic**: Customers with `customer_value_tier = VIP` should have `Avg_additional_charges_total > 300`

### **Data Quality Standards**
- **Completeness**: 100% - No missing values allowed
- **Accuracy**: ¬±5% variance acceptable for calculated fields
- **Consistency**: Cross-field validation rules enforced
- **Timeliness**: Monthly updates with 48-hour processing window
- **Validity**: All values within acceptable business ranges
